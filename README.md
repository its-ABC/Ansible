# Ansible Overview

## What is Ansible?

Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It simplifies complex IT tasks by allowing you to write simple, human-readable automation scripts in YAML (called "playbooks") without needing specialized coding skills.

## Key Features of Ansible

- **Agentless**: Ansible does not require any special software or agent installed on the target machines. It uses SSH to communicate with systems.
- **Simple and Readable**: Playbooks are written in YAML, a human-readable language, making it easy for beginners and experts alike to understand and implement tasks.
- **Modular**: Ansible has a vast collection of built-in modules that handle different tasks, such as file management, service control, package installation, etc.
- **Idempotency**: Ansible ensures that a task only makes the necessary changes to reach the desired state, avoiding repeated or unintended actions.
- **Scalability**: Ansible can handle large environments without the need for complex infrastructure.
- **Security**: It uses OpenSSH and security features like Ansible Vault for encrypting sensitive data.
- **Extensibility**: Users can create their own custom modules to extend functionality.
- **Efficient Orchestration**: Manages complex multi-tier applications and workflows by orchestrating services and resources across different systems.

## Why is Ansible Used?

- **Simplified Automation**: Ansible makes the automation of repetitive tasks easier and faster. You can automate server setup, application deployment, network configurations, and more.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: It allows infrastructure to be defined in code, version-controlled, and easily replicated.
- **Consistency**: Ansible ensures consistent setups across environments, whether youâ€™re managing a few servers or thousands.
- **Reduced Manual Errors**: By automating tasks, it minimizes human error that often happens with manual configurations.
- **Cross-platform Support**: Ansible works across various platforms, such as Linux, Windows, and cloud environments, making it versatile.

## How Were Things Done Before Ansible?

Before tools like Ansible, infrastructure and system management tasks were handled manually or with complex scripts. This led to:

- **Inconsistencies**: Manual processes often resulted in different environments being configured in different ways, leading to unpredictable issues.
- **Long Setup Times**: System administrators had to configure each machine individually, making deployment and scaling time-consuming.
- **Error-prone Operations**: With manual setups, there was a higher chance of mistakes, leading to failed configurations or missing dependencies.
- **Difficult Collaboration**: Lack of a standard tool meant that system configurations were often undocumented and not easily shared across teams.

Ansible solves these challenges by offering a streamlined, automated, and standardized way to manage infrastructure.
